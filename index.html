            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Due to it's use of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram">logographic</a> characters, Chinese is arguably the most
                complex and fascinating written language in the world. While most other
                civilizations and cultures developed alphabet-based writing systems, the unique
                and ancient Chinese writing system has survived thousands of years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each word in written Chinese is composed of a distinct character or combination of characters; characters offer
                no indication of how to pronounce the word. The pronunciations of each word
                must be memorized. The system is so inherently difficult that illiteracy was high
                in China for thousands of years. In fact, in the 1930's and 40's, Chinese scholars created
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters">simplified characters</a>
                in order to improve literacy.

            <p>
                The construction of Chinese character may seem arbitrary to a
                non-speaker, however each Chinese character has deep meaning and
                thousands of years of history encoded in it. Each Chinese
                character contains a component called a "radical," which itself
                is a character as well. Most radicals are each a component of
                multiple different characters, and sometimes the meaning of the
                radical carries over to several of the characters it appears in.
                Therefore, characters that look similar often have similar or
                related meanings.
