                Chinese is one of the most widely-spoken languages in the world, and due to it's use of characters (logograms) in writing, arguably the most fascinating. While most other civilizations and cultures developed writing systems based on alphabets, Chinese characters have survived thousands of years. Each word in Chinese has a distinct character or combination of characters; characters offer no indication of how to pronounce the word. The pronounciations of each word must be memorized. The system is so difficult that illiteracy was high in China for thousands of years, in fact, Chairman Mao created "simplified characters" in order to improve literacy and strengthen his campaign. <br>

                    <br> While English is the most widely-spoken language in the world, Chinese has by far the most native speakers. Here, "native speaker" means "first language." The graph below shows the number of native Chinese speakers versus native speakers of other languages. <br>

                        teaching and usage of the character. A good way to evaluate the complexity of a Chinese character is the stroke count. The visualization below shows the breakdown of all Chinese characters based on stroke count, grade level, and frequency.

                    The construction of Chinese character may seem arbitrary to a non-speaker, however each Chinese character has deep meaning and thousands of years of history encoded in it. Each Chinese character contains a component called a "radical," which itself is a character as well. Most radicals are each a component of multiple different characters, and sometimes the meaning of the radical carries over to several of the characters it appears in. Therefore, characters that look similar often have similar or related meanings.
                    <br><br> Furthermore, in modern Chinese, most words are in fact compound words, which means they are made up of two or more characters. The meaning of each compound word usually is related to it's respective components. The graphic below shows the construction of the compound word meaning "hello." It consists of the single character meaning "good," which is in turn made up of the radical meaning "woman."

The children of the root node are characters that consist of the root radical, and children of those nodes are compound words that contains that character. <strong>Note: </strong> there is a lot of dynamic data being parsed here, give the system a little time to load.
