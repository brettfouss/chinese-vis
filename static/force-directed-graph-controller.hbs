    <h6>The Composition of Chinese Words</h6>
    <p> Although each Chinese character is itself a distinct word, semantically, most
    words in Chinese are compound words composed of multiple characters.
    Furthermore, each Chinese character contains a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters)#Variations_in_the_number_of_radicals">
    radical</a>, essentially one of 214 simple characters contained within it.
    However, the relationship between radicals, characters and compound words
    is far from arbitrary. </p>
